o (fix) The behavior of PHP_Colon_Offset and PHP_Switch_Offset, they
  work funny together.
      
o (feature) Somehow add the functionality of html mode to php.sl.
     
o (feature) Add c comment/uncomment region functions.
  (Update): Can't think of a good reason to do this, personally
  I'm not to keen on the way php allows multiple way to comment
  things, so since i love c++ comments more than i love c comments
  that's what comment_region will do.

o (nonissue) Code that are inside " ' won't get parsed right, and that's because
  the indent routine sees it as inside a string and treat's it accordingly.
  If you're using ' " outside the phpblock, like in HTML code, then use the
  appropriate HTML encoding for those particular characters, actually i recommend
  you use those always according to HTML standards.
  Or even better, don't mix phpcode and html code, instead use a sane template
  module for php, there are lots of them.
