v0.1 2000-05-07
---------------
o Initial release

v0.2 2000-05-08
---------------
o Fixed so it comments a line correctly with // something.
o Fixed the comment_region and uncomment_region so they also work
  correctly and output c++ style comments //.
o Cleaned up the code, removed code that were not needed.
o Fixed the newline_and_indent functions so it worked as i wanted it to work.
o Fixed the top_of_function, it now recognizes both a { on a line by itself, or
  something like this function blaah ($dooh) {.
o Fixed the bug(sort of) that resulted in wrong indent if you had something like this
  // something http://
  the extra pair of slashes made it indent under them

v0.3 2000-05-08
---------------
o Fixed a bug in define key for php_comment_line, it pointed to a obsolete function.
o Fixed so php_mark_function now correctly works whet-ever the { is on a line
  by itself or if is it on the same line as the function start.
o Fixed the bug where indenting would misbehave after you had a
  some text and then a <?.
o Rewrote some of the html indenting code and misc code cleanup.

v0.3.1 2000-05-08
-----------------
o Back-ported my // fix out of the code, it didn't work as it should.

v0.3.1.1 2000-05-09
-------------------
o Removed the debugging messages from the script.

v0.4 2000-05-20
---------------
o Added folding info to the file.
o Updated the docs for the functions/key-bindings.
o Rewrote all define_keywords_n to not use strncat.
o Added a menu to the menu-bar with some of the functions.
o Updated the keyword list, it now contains all php3 and php4 keywords.

o Added better install instructions.

v0.5 2000-05-30
---------------
o Rewrote php_in_block, it now looks past commented out <?.
o Added misc key-bindings.
o Fixed indent region, now it doesn't matter if you start a region
  from bottom-to-up or vice-verse, it gets it right.
o Fix #4 for having multiple // on a line and that screwing up indenting.
o Removed some debugging messages.
o Removed some old code.
o Simplified the indent_buffer function.
o Rewrote the php_top_of_function, now it truly goes to the top of the
  function, and also sees if it is out of bounds or not in a function at all.
o Fixed php_mark_function, now it marks the entire function regardless of
  the existence of multiple braces inside the function.
o Simplified the php_is_comment_example function and renamed it to php_is_comment.
o Moved the to-do list into the top header of the file, easier to maintain.
o Added missing keyword class, global and globals.
o Added function php_insert_class.
o Added function php_insert_function.
o Swapped the keyword colors to be more in line with cmode and other
  modes, thanks David.
o Changed the syntax flag to be case insensitive and removed the extra ALL CASE
  keywords, thanks to David for the tips
o Fixed when you have a construct like 
  if (blaah)
    die
  it wrongly indents it under the if
  should work now.
o Some fixes in general in indenting.
o PHP_CONTINUED_OFFSET is now back.
o Added back the long keywords for v0.99.11

v0.6 2000-08-25
---------------
o # is now recognized as a comment.
o Added variable PHP_Autoinsert_Comments = 1, which set whet-ever
  a comment should automatically follow a comment when you
  do a newline.
  Ported it over from cmode.
o Updated the thanks list.
o Fixed so now PHP_BRACE now is recognized outside braces.
o Some cleanup in the engine.
o Added variable PHP_Class_Offset, which set amount
  of indenting inside a class, ported it over from cmode.
  Make a note, this only affects the amount of indenting inside
  the class, the braces aligns according to PHP_BRACE still.
o Fixed the indenting problem when you have text outside the 
  php block, thanks to Abraham vd Merwe for
  pointing that out.
o Removed the key-binding to php_format_paragraph, i couldn't make it work
  good, so ill try and code a new one, until then this is removed.

v0.7 2000-10-05
---------------
o Updated the docs on how to install and made sure they worked.
o Verified that all the the user variables works as expected.
o Added missing keywords and functions:
   array_rand
   imagegammacorrect
   swf_definepoly
   swf_ortho
   array_merge_recursive
   pg_trace
   pg_untrace
   set_error_handler
   create_function
   pg_loimport
   pg_loexport
   fflush
   str_pad
   imagewbmp
   imagecreatefromxbm
   array_unique
   array_intersect
   array_diff
   restore_error_handler
   spliti
   ImageCreateFromWBMP
   ImageColorClosestHWB
   ImageCopyMerge
   ImagePaletteCopy
   ImageTypes
   wordwrap
   ldap_compare
   strncasecmp
   ob_get_length
   php_uname
      
o Added all functions to the menu
o Added back a provisional format_paragraph, but
  it is ripped right out of c_mode and i don't honestly know
  what to do with it, any suggestions about what format_paragraph
  should do for phpmode is more than welcome.
o Fixed the wrong indenting within braces.
o Spell-checked my docs *DOOOH*
o Removed some debugging lines.
      
v0.8 2000-10-11
---------------
o Fixed some folding information.
o Added my new email address.
o Added missing definekey for php_format_paragraph
o Changed all "PHP" to use $1 instead
o Restructured the order of key-bindings and menu order, mostly cosmetic.
o Added php_blink_matching, if you put the cursor on a brace it marks
  the region between that and the matching one, nice visual, only 
  to find out about goto_match, try Ctrl-\, oh well i coded it and 
  now it stays :)
o Fixed/Changed the behavior of php_top_of_function, now it correctly reports
  that you're not in a function if you're missing a top brace.
o Changed the error message if php_top_of_function can't find the top brace of
  the function to say that it can't find the top brace of the function.
o Added a function to insert a literal TAB, default bound to Ctrl-C Ctrl-I
  Now, don't ask what it is for if you don't know.
o Changed the behavior of indenting outside a phpblock (i.e. <? ?>), now It
  just insert a TAB character, nothing fancy at all.
o Changed the heuristic of finding if you're inside a phpblock.
o Updated the 'things that are a non-issue' list
o Replaced the current php_indent_buffer code with the one from krconv.sl,
  actually i would have preferred to just autoload() it, but since this mode
  isn't a part of the standard shipment with jed i can't rely on the fact that
  krconv.sl will exists for someone, so i duplicate its functionality here for
  the present being and if this mode gets included into the mainstream package
  i suggest this gets remedied.
o Improved the heuristic on php_top_of_function, it now correctly doesn't find
  functions that are in a comment, since its valid syntax in php to break up the
  function line on many lines, I've dumbed down the heuristic of finding the top
  of the function, it now only looks for the word function and checks if it is not
  in a comment, this should be OK.

v0.9 2000-11-01
---------------
o Added new functions as of the php-4.0.3 release.
   EscapeShellArg
   is_uploaded_file
   move_uploaded_file
   pathinfo
   pg_put_line
   pg_end_copy
   ftp_exec
   session_cache_limiter
   curl_error
   curl_errno
   mysql_escape_string
o Added missing folding information
o Updated DFA highlighting, seems to work fine.
o Went over the docs for accuracy.
o Reworked the php_indent_buffer, should work better now
o Once again redid the php_top_of_function, it now has a more strict
  syntax check for finding a function top, at the moment it cannot
  find a function that is broken up on multiple lines.

v1.0 2000-11-04
---------------
o Added html style commenting to be recognized as a comment, only works in DFA.
o Fixed mark_function, now it no longer marks extra lines above and under
  the actual function, something that could make subsequent comment_region
  comment some extra lines out.
o Fixed some problem with # style comments, it should now works as //
o Added ASP style tags, ex. '<% %>',to be recognized as php delimiters.
o Fixed the regexp in DFA so one-liners like '<% echo ("As of PHP 3.0.4 you may optionally use ASP-style tags"); %>'
  now looks nicer.
o Updated the docs, added a section on DFA syntax.
o Added missing constants.
   __FILE__
   __LINE__
o Added missing functions.
   include_once
   require_once
o Fixed the folding, it now uses //{{{  and ///}}} as start and end
  fold markers.

v1.1 2000-12-04
---------------
o Fixed the comment/uncomment region code, it no longer moves the commented region to the 
  beginning of the line, it now also doesn't comments out a extra line at the end of the marked
  region.
   
v1.2 2001-01-13
---------------
o Added new functions as of php-4.0.4.
   is_null
   get_defined_functions
   get_defined_vars
   call_user_func_array
   constant
   ImageCreateFromString
   array_sum
   curl_getinfo
o These functions got renamed in the php-4.0.4 release.
   shm_attach     => shmop_attach
   shm_detach     => shmop_detach
   shm_get_var    => shmop_get_var
   shm_put_var    => shmop_put_var
   shm_remove     => shmop_remove
   shm_remove_var => shmop_remove_var
o Removed an extra php_paragraph_sep function that had somehow crept in.
o Ported C_Switch_Offset over from cmode to this mode and renamed it to
  PHP_Switch_Offset, it controls the offset of code inside a switch
  statement.
o Made php_mark_matching more generic, now it matches whatever you're standing on.
o Added back DFA syntax caching to on by default.
o Added separators to the menu to increase readability.

v1.3 2001-02-08
---------------
o Added a README file.
o Updated the DFA syntax.
o Fixed the keywords syntax highlight.
o Added a new Variable to customize the insertion of a }.
  PHP_KET_NEWLINE
  When set to 1 it inserts a newline before inserting a }.
  This new behavior somewhat breaks the old behavior with only
  PHP_BRA_NEWLINE, but IMHO it was already broken.
  But in case you want this behavior back, please tell me so
  and i will put in a Comp. hack for that in the next release.
o Fixed so comment_line now puts the comment at the beginning of the line.
o Replaced comment_region with a better one, mostly taken from comment.sl
  it also changes the behavior so comments are inserted at the beginning of
  the line.
o Some cleanup in uncomment_region code.

v1.4 2001-10-03
---------------
o Synced with the changes brought about with
  merging phpmode into the main distribution.

   array_search
   chroot
   udm_clear_search_limits
   mnogosearch

  is_callable
  pg_last_notice
  udm_cat_list
  udm_cat_path
  key_exists
  array_map
  array_filter
  mysql_unbuffered_query
o Added a php_indent_region_or_line function
  that replaces the old indent_region
  and is bound as default to the tab key.
  It checks to see if there is a region marked
  and indents either a line or the marked
  region accordingly.
  Thanks to Guenter Milde for the idea on how
  to do it.
o Finally broke down and put together a parser to extract all the function
  names from the php documentation, now every function as of php4.0.6 should
  be in phpmode. This somewhat doubled the number of functions in phpmode. *bliss*

v2.0 2002-06-30
---------------
o Reworked the way indent recognizes more than one // or # comment on
  a line.
o Updated the function keywords for highlighting according to php-4.2.1

v2.0.1 2002-08-20

v2.0.x xxxx-xx-xx
---------------
o Updated the function keywords for highlighting according to php-4.3.0
